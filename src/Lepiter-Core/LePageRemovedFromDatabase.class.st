I am sent by a {{gtClass:LePage}} after it is removed from the system. 

When pages are moved between databasess this announcement is not triggered, as the page is not removed just moved. I differ from {{gtClass:LeDatabasePageRemoved}} that indicated a page was removed from a database, and it is triggered by the database when pages are moved.
